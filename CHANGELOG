# v1.0.2 - ???
1. Changed interface to cmq_wait() to allow (optional) return
   value indicating approx how mch time in nanoseconds the element
   stayed in the queue.
   This is needed because callers might want to track queue performance
   and alter their behaviour accordingly. If callers do not want to
   get the queue element's lifetime the parameter can be NULL.

# v1.0.0 - Sat 06 Feb 2021 13:04:20 SAST

dequeue. Tested on Linux and Windows only.
