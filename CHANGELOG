# v1.0.3 - ???
1. Added build-script support for building for android and jni.

# v1.0.2 - Thu 25 Feb 2021 22:24:05 SAST
1. Changed interface to cmq_wait() to allow (optional) return
   value indicating approx how mch time in nanoseconds the element
   stayed in the queue.
   This is needed because callers might want to track queue performance
   and alter their behaviour accordingly. If callers do not want to
   get the queue element's lifetime the parameter can be NULL.

2. Changed locking protocol; no change to callers are required. The
   previous locking protocol made deadlocking probable. The fix now
   makes deadlock almost impossible by using only a single lock. This
   slows down insertion/removal from a queue by very little.

# v1.0.1 - Tue 09 Feb 2021 00:15:42 SAST

1. Renamed the nq and dq functions to wait and post respectively.
2. Changed the units of the timeouts from seconds to milliseconds.

# v1.0.0 - Sat 06 Feb 2021 13:04:20 SAST

Initial release, with only the bare minimm needed functions, enqueue and
dequeue. Tested on Linux and Windows only.
