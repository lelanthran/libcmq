=========================================================================
Change the implementation of queues to be based on fixed-array sizes
(messages received when the array is full mst be held or dropped by the
caller).

Currently we simply store all messages until the computer falls over
due to memory exhaustion. This is a poor default. Much better to let
the caller explicitly handle overflowing queues.

This means that the linked-list solution must be re-implemented as a
fixed-array (specified at runtime by the caller).
=========================================================================
Maybe not a bad idea to have serialisation of the qeue to file? Can be
done by requiring callers to provide a _element_write() call and an
_element_read() call.

This means that if serialisation is used then the elements in the queue
must all be readable and writable by the supplied functions.
